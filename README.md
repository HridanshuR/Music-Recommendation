# Perfect melody finder

Project for trying to find "the perfect melody" by inspecting most popular songs of all time.

## Summary

If might be possible to create few perfect songs in few/many genres by inspecting existing melogies in songs.
Target is to generate play notes from source data for machine or human to play.


## Background

I want to believe there's some kind of pattern behind everything. Even in arts. Or being precise, the success of some arts.


## How is it used?

First of all the program has to analyze a lot of songs and categorize them by genre and popularity.
Next part is to find similarities from them. Possibly also cross-genre similarities.

The results should be inspected by human to consider if they are logical in any way.


## Data sources and AI methods

Source has to be considered because we have to be careful what material is legal to use in this kind of project.
In theory we could use youtube as a source.


## Challenges

Result of audio analyzing could give unexpected results and there's no certainty can it be used witch will crash this project on the beginning.

## What next?

Next part will be to use AI to create a song based on results of this project.

## Acknowledgments

No sources. Sorry.
